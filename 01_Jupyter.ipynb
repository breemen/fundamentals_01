    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) is a browser-based development environment for data science projects. It is supported by a broad community of data scientists and AI researchers. Mixing documentation and code into one notebook is the most significant feature of Jupyter that allows creating beautiful and interactive reports. Jupyter supports multiple programming languages, which is implemented via 'kernels.' In this masterclass, we use the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language/kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How does it work?\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook consists of 'cells.' A cell can be a 'markdown' cell for typing documentation, 'code' cell for writing code, or a 'raw' cell. Use the mouse or up/down arrow keys to select a cell. From the pulldown menu above, you can change the cell type. You can also change the cell type by selecting it and using shortcuts: 'y' - code, 'm' for markdown, and 'r' for raw.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown cells\n",
    "To edit a markdown cell, double click on it or press 'Enter.' You will enter the 'edit' mode of the markdown cell. Special markdown characters can be used to format your text. A full overview of the formatting syntax can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/). Some of the most used markdowns are:"
