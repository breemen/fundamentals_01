    "There exists a more or less standard tool set for data science that consists of Jupyter, Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. Understanding these tools and having the skills to use them is needed to do more advanced deep learning experiments. Deep learning models often depend on other Python packages, such as Tensorflow, Keras and PyTorch that buiild upon the previous set of tools. \n",
